<font size="5"> 9gag Clone</font> <i>Well nearly (I guess? ðŸ˜†)<i>


## What Is This Repo/App ? ðŸ¤”

- I wanted to try to make the clone application of the 9gag. There is no public api for 9gag. So I decided to use <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">Giphy's dveleoper API</a> to get gif medias.
- I actually still working on the app for some feature implementations. ðŸ¤“
- Feel free to make pull requests for my issues or to improve the application ðŸ¥³ (performance optimization, styles etc.)


### Home Page

- Here is a little part of the app.
- You can checkout other features, Installation steps on <a href="https://github.com/SafaElmali/react-native-9gag.wiki.git">Wiki Page</a>
