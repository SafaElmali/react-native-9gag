## What Is This Repo/App ? ðŸ¤”

- I wanted to try to make the clone application of the 9gag. There is no public api for 9gag. So I decided to use <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">Giphy's develeoper API</a> to get gif medias.
- I actually still working on the app for some feature implementations. ðŸ¤“
- Feel free ask anything or make pull requests for app's issues or to improve the application ðŸ¥³ (performance optimization, styles etc.)

## Preview

- Here is a little part of the app.
